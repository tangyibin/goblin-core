**IMPORTANT** For those using the the source and tools from the GC64 SVN repository, we will soon be migrating the code repository to a Gitlab instance at Texas Tech University.  Google recently announced that they plan to end their code and project hosting services, thus forcing us to find a new home.  More info will be available soon.


The goal of this project is build an intelligent chip-multithreaded architecture and associated toolchain built specifically to solve data-intensive applications.  Target applications/algorithms include graph-theory, sparse matrix/sparse matrix-vector, n-body problems, combinatorics, gene/protein assembly and data mining.  As such, we strive to build in native latency hiding characteristics and highly intelligent/fine-grained thread scheduling.

We make use of novel forthcoming memory technologies, process techniques and extremely efficient ISA definitions to build an architecture that natively maps PGAS programming models at the extreme scale.
